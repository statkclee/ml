## 1. 해외 희곡

영국의 극작가이자 소설가인 오스카 와일드가 쓴 희곡 [진지함의 중요성(The Importance of Being Earnest)](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%A7%84%EC%A7%80%ED%95%A8%EC%9D%98%20%EC%A4%91%EC%9A%94%EC%84%B1)을 
[구텐베르그(gutenberg)](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/844/pg844.txt) 웹사이트에서 다운로드 받아 희곡에 등장하는 인물들의 대사횟수를 기준으로 중요도를 추출해본다.

### 1.1. 환경설정 및 데이터 가져오기 

`stringr`, `stringi`, `rebus` 팩키지는 텍스트, 문자열 처리를 위한 R 3종 세트 팩키지라 바로 불러오고 나서,
`tidyverse` 팩키지를 통해 데이터를 정제하는데 사용한다.

"진지함의 중요성" 희곡은 `readLines()` 함수에 구텐베르그 사이트 url을 바로 넣어 가져온다.

# 1. 데이터 가져오기 -------------------

text_844 <- readLines("http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/844/pg844.txt")
~~~

### 1.2. 데이터 정제

구텐베르그 프로젝트에 앞뒤 쪽 진지함의 중요성 희곡본문 내용을 감싼 내용이 있어 이를 제거하고, 
도입부와 연극 본문의 내용을 구분한다.


~~~{.r}
# 2. 데이터 정제 -------------------
## 2.1. 소설 본문 추출 시작과 끝 ------------------
start_line <- which(str_detect(text_844, pattern = fixed("START OF THE PROJECT")))
end_line   <- which(str_detect(text_844, pattern = fixed("END OF THE PROJECT")))

## 2.2. 소설 본문 추출
text_only  <- text_844[(start_line+1):(end_line-1)]

## 2.3. 도입(Intro)과 연극(Play) 구분
cutoff_line <- which(str_detect(text_only, pattern = fixed("FIRST ACT")))
cutoff_line_index <- 1:(cutoff_line-1)

## 2.4. 도입부와 연극으로 구분
intro_text <- text_only[cutoff_line_index]
play_text <-  text_only[-cutoff_line_index]
~~~

### 1.3. 정규식 적용 등장인물 추출

정규식을 적용하여 배우를 추출한다. "진지함의 중요성"에 총 9 명 배우가 나오는 사실은 알고 있으니,
이를 등장인물 `characters`로 정의하고 해당되는 행(라인)을 추출한다.


~~~{.r}
# 3. 출연 비중이 높은 배우 데이터 추출 ----------------------
## 3.1. 출연배우 정의 후 정규식 적용
characters <- c("Algernon", "Jack", "Lane", "Cecily", "Gwendolen", "Chasuble", 
                "Merriman", "Lady Bracknell", "Miss Prism")

## 3.2. 정규식
char_pattern <- START %R% or1(characters) %R% DOT

## 3.3. 정규식 적용결과 확인
str_view(play_text, char_pattern, match=TRUE)

I don't play<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.

I never think of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Very natural, I am sure.  That will do, Lane, thank you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Thank you, sir.  [Lane goes out.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  Really, if the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Mr. Ernest Worthing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Stiffly_._]  I believe it is customary in good society to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the country.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  What on earth do you do there?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Pulling off his gloves_._]  When one is in town one amuses<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  And who are the people you amuse?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Airily_._]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one of them.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  How immensely you must amuse them!  [Goes over and takes<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Why<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  How perfectly delightful!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  May I ask why?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have come up to town expressly to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  How utterly unromantic you are!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.  The Divorce Court was<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.  Divorces are<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, you have been eating them all the time.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That is quite a different matter.  She is my aunt.  [Takes<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Advancing to table and helping himself.]  And very good bread and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Why on earth do you say that?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, that is nonsense!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It isn't.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Your consent!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.  And before I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Rings bell.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Cecily!  What on earth do you mean?  What do you mean, Algy, by<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Of course it's mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.  This cigarette case<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Your aunt!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  'From little<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, produce my cigarette case first.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Where is that place in the country, by the way?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don't<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  What on earth do you mean?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I'm not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Then your wife will.  You don't seem to realise, that in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical.  It's perfectly easy<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.  There's<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I suppose so, if you want to.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  That's not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  No cucumbers!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That will do, Lane, thank you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had some<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>]  They seem to think I should be with him.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Thank you, Algernon.  It is very thoughtful of you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Certainly, mamma.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I do mean something else.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You really love me, Gwendolen?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Passionately!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Darling!  You don't know how happy you've made me.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  My own Ernest!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  But your name is Ernest.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a music<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Gwendolen, I must get christened at once--I mean we must get<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Married, Mr. Worthing?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I adore you.  But you haven't proposed to me yet.  Nothing<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well . . . may I propose to you now?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Gwendolen!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You know what I have got to say to you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, but you don't say it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Finished what, may I ask?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Reproachfully.]  Mamma!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Twenty-nine.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Between seven and eight thousand a year.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  In investments, chiefly.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Lady Bloxham?  I don't know her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  149.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I have lost both my parents.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am afraid I really don't know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Found!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  A hand-bag?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag--a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  The cloak-room at Victoria Station?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes.  The Brighton line.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I can<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Didn't it go off all right, old boy?  You don't mean to say<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, that is nonsense!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It isn't!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, I won't argue about the matter.  You always want to argue<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That is exactly what things were originally made for.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself . . . [A pause.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Is that clever?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  We have.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  What fools!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn't<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, that is nonsense.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I'll<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow.  It's a sort of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Of course it isn't!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I would rather like to see Cecily.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessively<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people.  Cecily and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, I'm hungry.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I never knew you when you weren't . . .<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh no!  I loathe listening.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, let us go to the Club?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, no!  I hate talking.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, no!  I can't bear looking at things.  It is so silly.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, what shall we do?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Nothing!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don't mind<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Gwendolen, upon my word!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something very<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My own darling!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression on<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Dear Gwendolen!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  There is a good postal service, I suppose?  It may be<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My own one!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  How long do you remain in town?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Till Monday.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Good!  Algy, you may turn round now.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Thanks, I've turned round already.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  You may also ring the bell.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Certainly.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [To Lane, who now enters.]  I will see Miss Fairfax out.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.  [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  A glass of sherry, Lane.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  To-morrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I shall probably not be back till Monday.  You can put up my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  Yes, sir.  [Handing sherry.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  It never is, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lane.<\/span>  I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  There's a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I love scrapes.  They are the only things that are never<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, that's nonsense, Algy.  You never talk anything but nonsense.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Nobody ever does.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Calling.]  Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I don't like German.  It isn't<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!  Sometimes he is so serious<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Drawing herself up.]  Your guardian enjoys the best of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Cecily!  I am surprised at you.  Mr. Worthing has many<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Shaking her head.]  I do not think that even I could<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How wonderfully clever you are!  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is what<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I suppose so.  But it seems very unfair.  And was your novel<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Alas! no.  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr. Chasuble!  This is indeed a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  And how are we this morning?  Miss Prism, you are, I trust,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, I am afraid I am.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  That is strange.  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism's<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.  He is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Egeria?  My name is Laetitia, Doctor.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you.  I find<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure.  We might go as far<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  That would be delightful.  Cecily, you will read your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  Horrid<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  He<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Takes the card and reads it.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentioned<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had better<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, Miss.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel rather<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn't<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have been<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I am glad to hear it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It is much pleasanter being here with you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I can't understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won't be<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  No: the appointment is in London.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  About my what?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to buy your outfit.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit.  He has no taste<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think you will require neckties.  Uncle Jack is sending<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Australia!  I'd sooner die.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh, well!  The accounts I have received of Australia and the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, but are you good enough for it?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I'm afraid I'm not that.  That is why I want you to reform me.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I'm afraid I've no time, this afternoon.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It is rather Quixotic of you.  But I think you should try.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I will.  I feel better already.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You are looking a little worse.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That is because I am hungry.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  How thoughtless of me.  I should have remembered that when one<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Thank you.  Might I have a buttonhole first?  I never have any<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  A Marechal Niel?  [Picks up scissors.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Why?  [Cuts a flower.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.  [Cecily puts the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  They are a snare that every sensible man would like to be<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, I don't think I would care to catch a sensible man.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.  You should get<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [With a scholar's shudder.]  Believe me, I do not deserve so<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Sententiously.]  That is obviously the reason why the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  But is a man not equally attractive when married?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  And often, I've been told, not even to her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Perhaps she followed us to the schools.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  This is indeed a surprise.  We did not look for you till<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Shakes Miss Prism's hand in a tragic manner.]  I have returned<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My brother.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  More shameful debts and extravagance?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Still leading his life of pleasure?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Your brother Ernest dead?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Quite dead.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  What a lesson for him!  I trust he will profit by it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence.  You have at<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Poor Ernest!  He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.  I had a telegram last<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Was the cause of death mentioned?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  A severe chill, it seems.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  As a man sows, so shall he reap.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!  None<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector's most constant<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh yes.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usually<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I don't remember anything about it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  But have you any grave doubts on the subject?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don't know if the thing<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Immersion!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh!  I don't see much fun in being christened along with other<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horrid<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Cecily!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  My child! my child!  [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as if<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Who?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  What nonsense!  I haven't got a brother.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, don't say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  These are very joyful tidings.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My brother is in the dining-room?  I don't know what it all means.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Good heavens!  [Motions Algernon away.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's hand?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Bunbury!  Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury or<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will never<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Never forgive me?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Never, never, never!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.  [Shakes with<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Cecily, you will come with us.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Certainly, Miss Prism.  My little task of reconciliation is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  We must not be premature in our judgments.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I feel very happy.  [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  What?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  His luggage?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, sir.  Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  Mr. Ernest has been<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, sir.  [Goes back into the house.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  What a fearful liar you are, Jack.  I have not been called<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes, you have.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I haven't heard any one call me.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I can quite understand that.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, Cecily is a darling.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that.  I don't like it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, I don't like your clothes.  You look perfectly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I certainly won't leave you so long as you are in mourning.  It<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, will you go if I change my clothes?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, if you are not too long.  I never saw anybody take so<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I think it has been a great success.  I'm in love with Cecily,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.  I thought you were<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  He's gone to order the dog-cart for me.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  He's going to send me away.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Then have we got to part?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am afraid so.  It's a very painful parting.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Thank you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  The dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [Algernon looks appealingly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, Miss.  [Exit Merriman.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest.  If you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Do you really keep a diary?  I'd give anything to look at it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a very<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, don't cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speak<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Speaking very rapidly.]  Cecily, ever since I first looked<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Cecily!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  The dog-cart is waiting, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  [Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.]  Yes, sir.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh, I don't care about Jack.  I don't care for anybody in the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You silly boy!  Of course.  Why, we have been engaged for the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  For the last three months?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But how did we become engaged?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignorance<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Did I give you this?  It's very pretty, isn't it?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It's the excuse<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only too<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, I couldn't possibly.  They would make you far too conceited.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But was our engagement ever broken off?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingers<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, darling, with a little help from others.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I am so glad.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  You'll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think I could break it off now that I have actually met<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  But what name?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Oh, any name you like--Algernon--for instance . . .<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  But I don't like the name of Algernon.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Rising.]  I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has never<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I must see him at once on a most important christening--I mean<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I shan't be away more than half an hour.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I'll be back in no time.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  What an impetuous boy he is!  I like his hair so much.  I must<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing.  On very<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Yes, Miss.  [Goes out.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women who<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  With pleasure!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  If you wish.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't think so.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am very fond of being looked at.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.]  You<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh no!  I live here.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Severely.]  Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Indeed?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Your guardian?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Sternly, in a calm voice.]  Yes, as usual.  [Merriman begins to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Five counties!  I don't think I should like that; I hate<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestable<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Sweetly.]  Sugar?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Severely.]  Cake or bread and butter?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [In a bored manner.]  Bread and butter, please.  Cake is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  Hand<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Rising.]  To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Catching sight of him.]  Ernest!  My own Ernest!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Gwendolen!  Darling!  [Offers to kiss her.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Draws back.]  A moment!  May I ask if you are engaged to be<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Laughing.]  To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Thank you.  You may!  [Offers her cheek.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Very sweetly.]  I knew there must be some misunderstanding,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I beg your pardon?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  This is Uncle Jack.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Receding.]  Jack!  Oh!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Here is Ernest.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Drawing back.]  A moment, Ernest!  May I ask you--are you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Looking round.]  To what young lady?  Good heavens!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Laughing.]  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.]  You may.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.  The<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Breaking away from Algernon.]  Algernon Moncrieff!  Oh!  [The<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Are you called Algernon?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I cannot deny it.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Oh!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Is your name really John?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Standing rather proudly.]  I could deny it if I liked.  I could<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [To Gwendolen.]  A gross deception has been practised on both of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  My poor wounded Cecily!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  My sweet wronged Gwendolen!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painful<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Cheerily.]  None!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even of any kind.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Let us go into the house.  They will hardly venture to come<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The most<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, you've no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he, dear Jack?  You<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.  I love her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily.  I adore her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Well, that is no business of yours.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  If it was my business, I wouldn't talk about it.  [Begins to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I say it's perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Rising.]  Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Offering tea-cake.]  I wish you would have tea-cake instead.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  That may be.  But the muffins are the same.  [He seizes the<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, but I have not been christened for years.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you are<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  It usen't to be, I know--but I daresay it is now.  Science is<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Picking up the muffin-dish.]  Oh, that is nonsense; you are<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Jack, you are at the muffins again!  I wish you wouldn't.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  But I hate tea-cake.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Algernon!  I have already told you to go.  I don't want you here.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I haven't quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  But I haven't got a cough.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Let us preserve a dignified silence.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followed<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  A most distasteful one.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  But we will not be the first to speak.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Certainly not.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactory<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend to<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voice<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Then you think we should forgive them?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes.  I mean no.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Could we not both speak at the same time?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time as<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearful<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [To Jack.]  Darling!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Merriman.<\/span>  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Good heavens!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitation<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regards<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must have<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  What did he die of?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctors<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bows<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I beg your pardon?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  They<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in that<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highest<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  And after six months nobody knew her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Yes, Aunt Augusta!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Cecily, you may kiss me!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  You are perfectly right in making some slight<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Then what is to be done, Cecily?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  What railway station?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  I must retire to my room for a moment.

I need hardly<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Chasuble.<\/span>  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Amazed.]  You?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Miss Prism.<\/span>  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Gwendolen.<\/span>  I never change, except in my affections.<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Cecily.<\/span>  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Every luxury that money could buy, including<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Algernon.<\/span>  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose,<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Lady Bracknell.<\/span>  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in<\/li>\n  <li><span class='match'>Jack.<\/span>  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.
