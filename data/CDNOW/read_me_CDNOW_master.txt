The file CDNOW_master.txt contains the entire purchase history up to the end of June 1998 of the cohort of 23,570 individuals who made their first-ever purchase at CDNOW in the first quarter of 1997. This CDNOW dataset was first used by Fader and Hardie (2001).

Each record in this file, 69,659 in total, comprises four fields: the customer's ID, the date of the transaction, the number of CDs purchased, and the dollar value of the transaction.

See "Notes on the CDNOW Master Data Set" (http://brucehardie.com/notes/026/) for details of how the 1/10th systematic sample (http://brucehardie.com/datasets/CDNOW_sample.zip) used in many papers was created.
